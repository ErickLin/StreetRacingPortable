Street Racing Portable
by: Erick Lin

NOTE: This was my submission for a CS 2110 assignment at Georgia Tech. The compiled game is contained inside the file "StreetRacingPortable.gba" which can be executed with a GBA emulator.

This game is a recreation of a tutorial included with the legacy versions of Game Maker. The objective is to avoid the other cars while picking up fuel to keep the tank full. Use the arrow keys to move in eight different directions and stay in one piece. The highway was never meant for outlaws - watch out for the police cars!
